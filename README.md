# ChessOnline by sggts04

**ChessOnline** is an online chess webapp **built using Socket.io and Expressjs(Nodejs)** in backend. You can join a particular room and make your friend join the same room, and you'll be put into a game against each other!
The game is validated server sided to remove console cheating but do send a ping or a PR if you see any improvements.

This project is **still under development** and the UI definitely needs a major improvement, I've been focusing on the main gameplay for now.

Local Setup Tutorial:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sggts04/ChessOnline
$ cd ChessOnline
$ npm install
$ node index.js
```
and then navigate to `localhost:3000`
